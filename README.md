### COFEE SALES PROJECT
Here's a polished version:

"We are excited to propose a strategic partnership to empower public secondary school students in Nigeria with digital literacy skills, bridging the gap and unlocking their full potential in the digital age.

As you are aware, many public secondary school students in Nigeria lack access to digital literacy skills, hindering their ability to compete in the digital workspace. Our organization aims to address this pressing issue through this project.

The proposed partnership will yield numerous benefits, including:

- Enhanced digital literacy skills for students
- Improved employability and competitiveness
- Strengthened partnership and networking opportunities

We have attached a detailed proposal and budget for the project, outlining our objectives, scope of work, and expected outcomes. We believe that together, we can make a significant impact and equip these students with the skills necessary to thrive in the digital economy.

Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and drive positive change."
